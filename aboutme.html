<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Shwetha — a passionate and dedicated student and aspiring software developer. I love solving problems through code and building projects that make a difference. Currently, I’m focused on honing my skills in programming, web development, and interview preparation to secure a top-tier job in tech.
    I’m always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate with like-minded people, and take on challenging projects. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring creative ways to bring ideas to life or working on my final year projects like the Mock Interview Buddy AI and Smart Complaint Box.
    
    Welcome to my portfolio! Feel free to explore my work and connect with me.
